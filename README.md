# LifeOS

A personal life dashboard that helps visualize long-term growth across key life pillars using data, trends, and reflection — not motivation or gamification.

## Project Info

**Live URL**: soon

LifeOS is a private, single-user web app designed to track and visualize progress across five core life domains:

- Finance  
- Career (Education + Professional Growth)  
- Health (Mental + Physical)  
- Spirituality  
- Hobbies  

The app focuses on clarity, balance, and direction by converting simple daily inputs into meaningful trends and visual summaries.

## Philosophy

- This is **not** a habit tracker  
- This is **not** a to-do list or productivity app  
- Users never directly “rate” themselves  
- All scores are **derived**, not manually entered  
- Emphasis is on trends over time, not daily perfection  

The experience is meant to feel like a **personal analytics dashboard for life**, inspired by data tools such as Sheetlabs, but applied to personal development.

## How This Project Was Built

This project was created using **Lovable**, an AI-assisted web development platform.

Lovable was intentionally used to:
- Rapidly scaffold UI and layout
- Focus more on product thinking and system design
- Iterate quickly on structure and visuals

While the core idea, product direction, and UX decisions are original, much of the implementation and boilerplate code was generated and iterated using Lovable.

This project does **not** aim to claim full manual coding credit.
